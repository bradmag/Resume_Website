          Dear <b>[Employer's Name],</b> <br /><br />

          I’m Bradley Magee, and I’m thrilled you’ve taken the time to check out
          my website. I created this site to give you a better sense of who I
          am, what I’ve been working on, and where I’m headed.<br /><br />

          A bit about me: I’m currently studying Computer Engineering, and I’ve
          had some exciting experiences along the way. Recently, I interned as a
          Manual Test Engineer at Gogo Business Aviation, where I got to dive
          deep into quality assurance, working on everything from front-end code
          to hardware testing. It was a hands-on role that really sharpened my
          skills in JavaScript, CSS, and SQL, and it made me realize how much I
          enjoy being part of a team that brings innovative ideas to life.<br /><br />

          Teaching has also been a big part of my journey. At Metro State
          University of Denver, I’ve had the opportunity to work as an
          Engineering Tutor and Teaching Assistant. I’ve loved helping other
          students navigate complex concepts in computer science and
          engineering—it’s been incredibly rewarding to watch them grow and
          succeed.<br /><br />

          On this site, you’ll find my resume, which details my work experience,
          skills, and education. I’ve also included a cover letter where I talk
          a bit more about what I’m looking for and how I think I can contribute
          to a team like yours. I’m particularly drawn to
          <b>[Company Name]</b> because
          <b>[mention something specific about the company that excites you]</b
          >. <br /><br />

          I’d love to connect and explore how my background might align with
          what you’re looking for. Feel free to browse through my site, and
          don’t hesitate to reach out if you’d like to chat further. I’m excited
          about the possibility of working together and contributing to
          <b>[Company Name]</b>.<br /><br />

          Thanks again for visiting my site! <br /><br />

          Best, <br />
          Bradley Magee
