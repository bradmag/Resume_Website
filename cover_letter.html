          Dear Hiring Manager, <br /><br />

          I’m Bradley Magee, and I’m excited to apply for the Test Engineer
          position at Amazon. I’m in the process of making my personal website
          to provide a comprehensive view of my background, skills, and
          experiences, which I believe align well with the requirements of this
          role.<br /><br />

          With a background in Computer Engineering and recent experience as a
          Manual Test Engineer at Gogo Business Aviation, I’ve developed a
          strong foundation in quality assurance. My role involved AWS framework
          knowledge, Postman, and knowledge of the full stack development
          process and languages. This experience has honed my ability to
          identify issues, ensure high-quality deliverables, and collaborate
          effectively with cross-functional teams.<br /><br />

          In addition to my technical skills, I’ve worked as an Engineering
          Tutor and Teaching Assistant at Metro State University of Denver. This
          role allowed me to support students in understanding complex concepts,
          reinforcing my communication skills and my ability to convey technical
          information clearly.<br /><br />

          I’m particularly drawn to Amazon because of its innovative approach to
          technology and its commitment to delivering high-quality products. I’m
          enthusiastic about the opportunity to contribute to your team and help
          drive the success of Amazon’s cutting-edge projects.<br /><br />

          Best regards, <br />
          Bradley Magee
