# Recipe Book
## This will a cite where people can enter their favorite recipes into a database, then they can search the database by Ingredient or Recipe Name.


## Current Functionality:
- User can enter recipes into the database
- User can search for recipes by ingredients (BUG: returns broken link to recipes)

## Goals:
- User can search for recipes by name
- Update styling
- User can add more to recipes added (pictures, videos, Background pictures)
- If cimplicated recipes contain ingredients that are also their own recipes, enable links. (bolognese has mirepoix as an ingredient)
