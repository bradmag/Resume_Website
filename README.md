# Resume_Website
## This will be a multiple-page website. The main components will be a recipe page, then it will have a cover letter page, and a page to hold the projects I'm working on.

## Why
### I'm trying to learn how to develop websites. Getting a software test engineer position peacked my interest in developing websites and ensuring full stack functionality. I've learned how powerful websites can be for storing and compartmentalizing data and delivering various solutions to customers.

## How
### I have a 'you can learn how' mentality. I've always been astonished by the number of online resources, so I'm taking it one step at a time. First I learned the basics for front-end development, by styling a resume/cover letter website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Next, I learned database management using tools like SQLite and DBeaver. Then I started working on more full-stack projects like the Recipe Book, or the Fitness Trainer. These projects will test my QA abilities by developing something myself from the ground up.
