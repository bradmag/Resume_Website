# Resume_Website
## This will be a multiple-page website. The main components will be a recipe page, then it will have a cover letter page, and a page to hold the projects I'm working on.

## Why
### I'm trying to learn how to develop websites. Getting a software test engineer position peacked my interest in developing websites and ensuring full stack functionality. I've learned how powerful websites can be for storing and compartmentalizing data and delivering various solutions to customers.

## How
### I have a 'you can learn how' mentality. I've always been astonished by the number of online resources, so I'm taking it one step at a time. First I learned the basics for front-end development, by styling a resume/cover letter website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Next, I learned database management using tools like SQLite and DBeaver. Then I started working on more full-stack projects like the Recipe Book, or the Fitness Trainer. These projects will test my QA abilities by developing something myself from the ground up.

## Projects:
### Recipe Book
I started this project to learn back-end development. The front end is just a simple form for submitting and searching for recipes. The back end should have most of the complexity. The user should be able to search for an ingredient or multiple ingredients, then the back end will search the database and return any recipes with those ingredients. 

I have three tables: 
 - A recipe table with the Name, process, and an ID
 - An Ingredient table with the Name and an ID
 - Then a recipe_ingredient table. This will have a column for recipe ID, Ingredient ID and quantity.
The recipe_ingredient table will link the recipes with the ingredient, and quantity, needed. (ingredients can be used in multiple recipes so they should be stored in separate tables with another table to link them.
